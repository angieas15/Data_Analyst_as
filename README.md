# Data_Analyst_as
Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Angie Aragon, and in this repository, you will find projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, visualization, and detailed report presentation. For each project, I used tools like Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, and Excel to analyze data and create comprehensive reports with insights and recommendations. I am always eager to improve my skills and learn new tools to provide better solutions.
