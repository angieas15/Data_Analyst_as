# Data_Analyst_as
Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Angie Aragon, and in this repository, you will find projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, visualization, and detailed report presentation. For each project, I used tools like Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, and Excel to analyze data and create comprehensive reports with insights and recommendations. I am always eager to improve my skills and learn new tools to provide better solutions.


## Projects

In this project, I analyzed the sales data of a bakery located in Pucon, Chile, and visualized the results using Excel and Tableau.
